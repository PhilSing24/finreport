Thank you, Toshiya. We delivered another strong quarter with revenue of 44 billion, up 69% year over year, exceeding our outlook in what proved to be a challenging operating environment. Data center revenue of 39 billion grew 73% year-on-year. Our workloads have transitioned strongly to inference and AI factory buildouts are driving significant revenue. Our customers commitments are firm. On April 9th, the US government issued new export controls on H20, our data center GPU designed specifically for the China market. We sold H20 with the approval of the previous administration. Although our H20 has been in the market for over a year and does not have a market outside of China, the new export controls on H20 did not provide a grace period to allow us to sell through our inventory. In Q1, we recognized 4.6 billion in H20 revenue which occurred prior to April 9th, but also recognized a 4.5 billion charge as we wrote down inventory and purchase obligations tied to orders we had received prior to April 9th. We were unable to ship 2.5 billion in H20 revenue in the first quarter due to the new export controls. The 4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to reuse certain materials. We are still evaluating our limited options to supply data center compute products compliant with the US government's revised export control rules. Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly 50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide.

Our Blackwell ramp, the fastest in our company's history, drove a 73% year-on-year increase in data center revenue. Blackwell contributed nearly 70% of data center compute revenue in the quarter with a transition from Hopper nearly complete. The introduction of GB200 NVL was a fundamental architectural change to enable data center scale workloads and to achieve the lowest cost per inference token. While these systems are complex to build, we have seen a significant improvement in manufacturing yields and rack shipments are moving to strong rates to end
customers. GB200 NVL racks are now generally available for model builders, enterprises, and sovereign customers to develop and deploy AI. On average, major hyperscalers are each deploying nearly 1,000 NVL 72 racks or 72,000 Blackwell GPUs per week and are on track to further ramp output this quarter. Microsoft, for example, has already deployed tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs and is expected to ramp to hundreds of thousands of GB200s with OpenAI as one of its key customers. Key learnings from the GB200 ramp will allow for a smooth transition to the next phase of our product roadmap. Blackwell Ultra sampling of GB300 systems began earlier this month at the major CSPs and we expect production shipments to commence later this quarter. GB 300 will leverage the same architecture, same physical footprint, and the same electrical and mechanical specifications as GB200. The GB300 drop-in design will allow CSPs to seamlessly transition their systems and manufacturing used for GB200 while maintaining high yields. B300 GPUs with 50% more HBM will deliver another 50% increase in dense FP4 inference compute performance compared to the B200. We remain committed to our annual product cadence with our roadmap extending through 2028 tightly aligned with the multiple year planning cycles of our customers.

We are witnessing a sharp jump in inference demand. Open AI, Microsoft and Google are seeing a step function leap in token generation. Microsoft processed over 100 trillion tokens in Q1, a fivefold increase on a year-over-year basis. This exponential growth in Azure OpenAI is representative of strong demand for Azure AI foundry as well as other AI services across Microsoft's platform. Inference serving startups are now serving models using B200, tripling their token generation rate and corresponding revenues for high value reasoning models such as Deepseek R1 as reported by artificial analysis. Nvidia Dynamo on Blackwell NVL72 turbocharges AI inference throughput by 30x for the new reasoning models sweeping the industry. Developer engagements increased with adoption ranging from LLM providers such as Perplexity to financial services institutions such as Capital One who reduced agentic chatbot latency by 5x with Dynamo. In the latest ML Perf inference results, we submitted our first results using GB200 and BL72, delivering up to 30x higher inference throughput compared to our 8 GPU H200 submission on the challenging Llama 3.1 benchmark. This feat was achieved through a combination of tripling the performance per GPU as well as 9x more GPUs all connected on a single NVLink domain. And while Blackwell is still early in its life cycle, software optimizations have already improved its performance by 1.5x in the last month alone. We expect to continue improving the performance of Blackwell through its operational life as we have done with Hopper and Emperor. For example, we increase the inference performance of Hopper by four times over two years. This is the benefit of Nvidia's programmable CUDA architecture and rich ecosystem.

The pace and scale of AI factory deployments are accelerating, with nearly 100 NVIDIA-powered AI factories in flight this quarter, a twofold increase year-over-year, with the average number of GPUs powering each factory also doubling in the same period. More AI factory projects are starting across industries and geographies. NVIDIA's full-stack architecture is underpinning AI factory deployments as industry leaders like AT&T, BYD, Capital One, Foxconn, MediaTek, and Telenor are strategically vital sovereign clouds like those recently announced in Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, and the UAE. We have a line of sight to projects requiring tens of gigawatts of NVIDIA AI infrastructure in the not-too-distant future. The transition from generative to agentic AI — AI capable of perceiving, reasoning, planning, and acting — will transform every industry, every company, and country. We envision AI agents as a new digital workforce capable of handling tasks ranging from customer service to complex decision-making processes. We introduced the Llama Nemotron family of open reasoning models designed to supercharge agentic AI platforms for enterprises built on the Llama architecture. These models are available as NIMs — NVIDIA Inference Microservices — with multiple sizes to meet diverse deployment needs. Our post-training enhancements have yielded a 20% accuracy boost and a 5x increase in inference speed. Leading platform companies including Accenture, Cadence, Deloitte, and Microsoft are transforming work with our reasoning models. NVIDIA NeMo microservices, generally available across industries, are being leveraged by leading enterprises to build, optimize, and scale AI applications. With Nemo, Cisco increased model accuracy by 40% and improved response time by 10x in its code assistant. NASDAQ realized a 30% improvement in accuracy and response time in its AI platform’s search capabilities, and Shell’s custom LLM achieved a 30% increase in accuracy when trained with NVIDIA NeMo. NeMo's parallelism techniques accelerated model training time by 20% compared to other frameworks. We also announced a partnership with Yum! Brands — the world's largest restaurant company — to bring NVIDIA AI to 500 of its restaurants this year, expanding to 61,000 restaurant over time, to streamline order-taking, optimize operations, and enhance service across its restaurants. For AI-powered cybersecurity, leading companies like Checkpoint, CrowdStrike, and Palo Alto Networks are using NVIDIA's AI security and software stack to build, optimize, and secure agentic workflows — with CrowdStrike realizing 2x faster detection triage with 50% less compute cost.

Moving to networking, sequential growth in networking resumed in Q1 with revenue up 64% quarter-over-quarter to 5 billion. Our customers continue to leverage our platform to efficiently scale up and scale out AI factory workloads. We created the world's fastest switch, NV Link. for scale up our NVLink compute fabric in its fifth generation offers 14x the bandwidth of PCIe Gen5. NVLink 72 carries 130 terabytes per second of bandwidth in a single rack, equivalent to the entirety of the world's peak internet traffic. NVLink is a new growth vector and is off to a great start with Q1 shipments exceeding a billion dollars. At Computex, we announced NVLink Fusion. Hypersscale customers can now build semicustom CCUs and accelerators that connect directly to the Nvidia platform with NVLink. We are now enabling key partners including ASIC providers such as MediaTek, Marvell Technologies and Astera Labs as well as CPU suppliers such as Fujitsu and Qualcomm to leverage NVLink fusion to connect our respective ecosystems. For scale out, our enhanced Ethernet offerings deliver the highest throughput, lowest latency networking for AI. Spectrum-X posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth and is now annualizing over 8 billion in revenue. Adoption is widespread across major CSPs and consumer internet companies including Coreweave, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, and XAI. This quarter, we added Google Cloud and Meta to the growing list of Spectrum-X customers. We introduced Spectrum-X and Quantum-X silicon photonix switches featuring the world's most advanced co-package optics. These platforms will enable next level AI factory scaling to millions of GPUs through the increasingly power efficiency by 3.5x and network resiliency by 10x while accelerating customer time to market by 1.3x.

Transitioning to a quick summary of our revenue by geography. China as a percentage of our data center revenue was slightly below our expectations and down sequentially due to H20 export licensing controls. For Q2, we expect a meaningful decrease in China data center revenue. As a reminder, while Singapore represented nearly 20% of our Q1 bill revenue, as many of our large customers use Singapore for centralized invoicing, our products are almost always shipped elsewhere. Note that over 99% of H100, H200 and Blackwell data center compute revenue build to Singapore was for orders from US-based customers.

Moving to gaming and AI PCs, gaming revenue was a record 3.8 billion, increasing 48% sequentially and 42% year-on-year. Strong adoption by gamers, creatives, and AI enthusiasts have made Blackwell our fastest ramp ever. Against a backdrop of robust demand, we greatly improved our supply and availability in Q1 and expect to continue these efforts in Q2. AI is transforming PC and creator and gamers. With a 100 million user installed base, GeForce represents the largest footprint for PC developers. This quarter, we added to our AI PC laptop offerings, including models capable of running Microsoft's Copilot Plus. This past quarter, we brought Blackwell architecture to mainstream gaming with its launch of GeForce RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti, starting at just $299. The RTX 5060 also debuted in laptops starting at $1,099. These systems that double the frame rate and slash latency. These GeForce RTX 5060 and 5060Ti desktop GPUs and laptops are now available. In console gaming, the recently unveiled Nintendo Switch 2 leverages Nvidia's neuro rendering and AI technologies, including next generation custom RTX GPUs with DLSS technology to deliver a giant leap in gaming performance to millions of players worldwide. Nintendo has shipped over 150 million Switch consoles to date, making it one of the most successful gaming systems in history. Moving to pro visualization, revenue of 509 million was flat sequentially and up 19% year-on-year. Tariff related uncertainty temporarily impacted Q1 systems and demand for our AI workstations is strong and we expect sequential revenue growth to resume in Q2. NVIDIA DGX Spark and Station revolutionize personal computing by putting the power of an AI supercomputer in a desktop form factor. DGX Spark delivers up to one petaflop of AI compute while DGX station offers an incredible 20 petaflops and is powered by the GB300 superchip. DGX Spark will be available in calendar Q3 and DGX station later this year. We have deepened Omniverse's integration and adoption into some of the world's leading software platforms including Databricks, SAP and Schneider Electric. New Omniverse blueprints such as Mega for at-scale robotic fleet management are being leveraged in Keon Group, Pegatron, Accenture and other leading companies to enhance industrial operations. At Computex, we showcased Omniverse's great traction with technology manufacturing leaders including TSMC, Quanta, Foxconn, Pegatron. Using Omniverse, TSMC saves months in work by designing FABS virtually. Foxconn accelerates thermal simulations by 150x and Pegatron reduced assembly line defects rates by 67%.

Lastly, with our automotive group, revenue was 567 million, down 1% sequentially, but up 72% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving across a number of customers and robust end demand for NEVs. We are partnering with GM to build the next gen vehicles, factories, and robots using NVIDIA AI, simulation, and accelerated computing. And we are now in production with our full stack solution for Mercedes vans starting with the new CLA hitting roads in the next few months. We announced Isaac Group and one the world's first open fully customizable foundation model for human humanoid robots enabling generalized reasoning and skill development. We also launched new open NVIDIA Cosmo World Foundation models. Leading companies include 1X Technologies, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, Uber, and Waaby. We've begun integrating Cosmos into their operations for synthetic data generation while Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, and Xpen Robotics are harnessing Isaac simulation to advance their humanoid efforts. GE Healthcare is using the new NVIDIA Isaac platform for healthcare simulation built on NVIDIA Omniverse and using NVIDIA Cosmos.

All right, moving to the rest of the P&L. GAP gross margins and non-GAAP gross margins were 60.5% and 61% respectively. Excluding the 4.5 billion charge, Q1 non-GAAP gross margins would have been 71.3, slightly below above our outlook at the beginning of the quarter. Sequentially, GAP operating expenses were up 7% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 6%, reflecting higher compensation and employee growth. Our investments include expanding our infrastructure capabilities and AI solutions, and we plan to grow these investments throughout the fiscal year. In Q1, we returned a record 14.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our capital return program continues to be a key element of our capital allocation strategy. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter. Total revenue is expected to be 45 billion plus or minus 2%. We expect modest sequential growth across all of our platforms. In data center, we anticipate the continued ramp of Blackwell to be partially offset by a decline in China revenue. Note, our outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion for the second quarter. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. We expect better Blackwell profitability to drive modest sequential improvement in gross margins. We are continuing to work towards achieving gross margins in the mid70s range late this year. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 5.7 billion and 4 billion respectively and we continue to expect full year fiscal year 26 operating expense growth to be in the mid 30% range. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately 450 million excluding gays and losses from non-marketable and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 16.5% plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items.

TEXT:
Thanks, Colette. We've had a busy and productive year. Let me share my perspective on some topics were frequently asked. On export control, China is one of the world's largest AI markets and a springboard to global success. With half of the world's AI researchers based there, the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally. Today, however, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China. We cannot reduce Hopper further to comply. As a result, we are taking a multi-billion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. We are exploring limited ways to compete, but Hopper is no longer an option. China's AI moves on with or without US chips. It has to compute to train and deploy advanced models. The question is not whether China will have AI. It already does. The question is whether one of the world's largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chip makers from US competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position. Export restrictions have spurred China's innovation and scale. The AI race is not just about chips. It's about which stack the world runs on. As that stack grows to include 6G and quantum, US global infrastructure leadership is at stake. The US has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable and now it's clearly wrong. China has enormous manufacturing capability. In the end, the platform that wins the AI developers win AI. Export controls should strengthen US platforms, not drive half of the world's AI talent to rivals

On DeepSeek, Deepseek and Qwen from China are among the best open-source AI models released freely. They've gained traction across the US, Europe, and beyond. Deepseek-R1 like Chat GPT introduced reasoning AI that produces better answers the longer it thinks. Reasoning AI enables step-by-step problem solving, planning, and tool use. Turning models into intelligent agents. Reasoning is compute intensive. Requires hundreds to thousand times more tokens per task than previous one-shot inference. Reasoning models are driving a step function surge in inference demand. AI scaling laws remain firmly intact not only for training but now inference too requires massive scale compute. Deepseek also underscores the strategic value of open-source AI. When popular models are trained and optimized on US platforms, it drives usage feedback and continuous improvement reinforcing American leadership across the stack. US platforms must remain the preferred platform for open-source AI. That means supporting collaboration with top developers globally, including in China. America wins when models like Deep Seek and Qwen run best on American infrastructure.

QUESTION:
Great. Thank you. Um, you guys have talked about this scaling up of inference around reasoning models for, you know, at least a year now and we've really seen that come to fruition as you talked about. We've heard it from your customers. Can you give us a sense for how much of that demand you know you're able to serve and give us a sense for maybe how big the inference business is for you guys and you know do we need full-on NVL72 rack scale solutions for reasoning inference going forward?

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang
ROLE: Founder, President, CEO & Director
TIME: 0:33:39
ANSWER:
well we would like to serve all of it and I think we're on track to serve most of it. Grace Blackwell, NVLink72 is the ideal engine today, the ideal computer thinking machine, if you will, for reasoning AI. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is that the token generation amount, the number of tokens reasoning goes through is a hundred a thousand times more than a one-shot chatbot. You know, it's essentially thinking to itself, breaking down a problem step by step. It might be planning multiple paths to an answer. It could be using tools, reading PDFs, reading web pages, watching videos and then producing a result, an answer. The longer it thinks, the better the answer, the smarter the answer is. And so what we would like to do and the reason why Grace Blackwell was designed to give such a giant step-up in inference performance is so that you could do all this and still get a response as quickly as possible. Compared to Hopper, Grace Blackwell is some 40 times higher speed and throughput compared. And so this is going to be a huge benefit and driving down the cost while improving the quality of response with excellent quality of service at the same time. So that's the fundamental reason that was the core driving reason for Grace Blackwell and NVLink 72. Of course, of course, in order to do that, uh we had to reinvent literally redesign the entire way that these supercomputers are built but now we're in full production. It's going to be exciting. It's going to be incredibly exciting.

QUESTION: 0:36:12
Thanks for the question. Just a clarification for Colette first. So on the China impact, I think previously you mentioned it was about $15 billion and you had the 8 billion in Q2. So is there still some remaining headwind for the cominq quarters? Just call how to model. Then question Jensen for you. Back at GTC you had outlined a path towards almost a trillion dollars of AI spending over the next few years. Where are we in that build-out and do you think it's going to be uniform that you will see every spender whether it's CSP, sovereigns, enterprises or build out? Should we expect some periods of digestion in between? Just what are your customer discussions telling you about how to model growth for next year?

RESPONDER: Colette Kress
ROLE: EVP & CFO
TIME: 0:37:05
ANSWER:
Yes, Vivek thanks so much for the question regarding H20. Yes, we recognized 4.6 H20 in Q1. We were unable to ship 2 and a half billion. So the total for Q1 should have been 7 billion. When we look at our Q2, our Q2 is going to be meaningly down in terms of China data center revenue and we had highlighted in terms of the amount of orders that we had planned for H20 and Q2 and that was 8 billion. Now going forward we did um have other orders going forward that we will not be able to fulfill. That is what was incorporated therefore in the amount that we wrote down of the $4.5 billion. That write down was about inventory and purchase commitments. And our purchase commitments were about what we expected regarding the orders that we had received. Going forward though it's a bigger issue regarding the amount of the market that we will not be able to serve. We assess that TAM (Total Addressable Market) to be close to about 50 billion in the future as we don't have a product to enable for the China.

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang

ANSWER:
Vivek, probably the best way to think through it. AI is several things you know of course we know that AI is this incredible technology that's going to transform every industry you know from of course the way we do software to healthcare and financial services to you know retail to I guess every industry: transportation, manufacturing. And we're at the beginning of that. But maybe another way to think about that is where do we need intelligence? Where do we need digital intelligence? And it's in every country. It's in every industry. And we know because of that we recognize that AI is also an infrastructure. It's a way of developing a technology that requires factories and these factories produce tokens and they as I mentioned are important to every single industry in every single country and so on that basis we're really at the very beginning of it because the adoption of this technology is really kind of in early stages. Now we've reached an extraordinary milestone with AIs that are reasoning are thinking what people call inference time scaling. You know, of course, we've entered an era where inference is going to be a significant part of the compute workload. But anyhow it's going to be a new infrastructure and we're building it in the clouds. the United States is really the early starter and available in US clouds and this is our largest market our largest installed base and we're continue to see that happening but beyond that we're going to see AI go into enterprise which is on prem because so much of the data still on prem. Access control is really important and it's really hard to move all of every company's data into the cloud. And so we're going to move AI into the enterprise. And you saw that we announced a couple of really exciting new products. Our RTX Pro enterprise AI server that runs everything enterprise and AI. Our DJX Spark and DJX Station which is designed for developers who want to work on prem. And so enterprise AI is just taking off. Today, a lot of the telco infrastructure uh will be in the future software defined and built on AI and so 6G is going to be built on AI and that infrastructure needs to be built out and it's at its very early stages and then of course every factory today that makes things will have an AI factory that sits with it and the AI factory is going to drive creating AI and operating AI for the factory itself but also to power the products and the things that are made by the factory. So it's very clear that every car company will have AI factories and uh very soon there will be robotics companies, robot companies and those companies will be also building AIs to drive the robots and so we're at the beginning of all of this buildout.

Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. There have been many large GPU cluster investment announcements in the last month and you alluded to, you know, a few of them with Saudi Arabia, UAE, uh, and then also, you know, we've heard from Oracle and XAI, just to name a few. So my question, are there other that have yet to be announced of the same kind of scale and magnitude? And perhaps more importantly, how are these orders impacting your lead times for Blackwell in your current visibility sitting here today? You know, almost halfway through 2025.

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang

TIME: 0:43:03
ANSWER:
Well, we have more orders today than we did at the last time I spoke about orders at GTC. However, we're also uh increasing our supply chain and building out our supply chain. They're doing a fantastic job. We're building it here on shore United States but we're going to keep our supply chain quite busy for several many more years coming. With respect to further announcements, I'm going to be on the road next week through Europe and it's  just about every country needs to build out AI infrastructure and they're tens AI factories being planned. In the remarks Colette mentioned there's some 100 AI factories being built. There's a whole bunch that haven't been announced. I think the important concept here and which makes it you know easier to understand is that like other technologies that impact literally every single industry of course electricity was one and it became infrastructure. Of course, the information infrastructure which we know as the internet affects every single industry, every country, every society. Intelligence is surely one of those things. I don't know any company, industry, country who thinks that intelligence is optional. It's essential infrastructure. And so we've now digitalized intelligence. And so I think we're clearly in the beginning of the buildout of this infrastructure and every country will have it. I'm certain of that. Every industry will use it. That I'm certain of. And what's unique about this infrastructure is that it needs factories. Um you know, it's a little bit like the energy infrastructure, electricity. It needs factories. We need factories to produce this intelligence and the intelligence is getting more sophisticated. We were talking about earlier that we had a huge breakthrough in the last couple of years with reasoning AI and now they're agents that reason and there's super agents that use a whole bunch of tools and then there's clusters of super agents where agents are working with agents solving problems. And so you could just imagine compared to one shot chat bots and the agents that are now using AI built on these large language models how much more compute intensive they really need to be and are. And so I think we're in the beginning of the buildout and there should be there should be many more announcements in the future.

QUESTION:
Yeah, hi, thanks for the question. I wanted to ask first to Colette, just a little clarification around the guidance and maybe putting it in a different way. You know, the 8 billion for H20 just seems like it's roughly three billion more than most people thought with regard to what you'd be foregoing in the second quarter. So that would mean that with regard to your guidance, the rest of the business in order to hit 45 is doing two to three billion or so better. I was wondering if that math made sense to you, and then in terms of the guidance, that would imply the non-China business is doing a bit better than the street expected. So I was wondering what the primary driver was there in your view. And then, the second part of my question, Jensen, I know you guide one quarter at a time, but with regard to the AI diffusion rule being lifted and this momentum with sovereign, there have been times in your history where you’ve said on calls like this that you have more conviction in sequential growth throughout the year. Given the unleashing of demand with AI diffusion being revoked and the supply chain increasing, does the environment give you more conviction in sequential growth as we go throughout the year? So first one for Colette, and then the next one for Jensen. Thanks so much

ANSWER:
Thanks, Ben, for the question. When we look at our Q2 guidance and the commentary that we provided, had the export controls not occurred, we would have had orders of about 8 billion for H20. That’s correct — that was a possibility for what we would have had in our outlook for this quarter in Q2. What we also have talked about here is the growth that we’ve seen in Blackwell across many of our customers, as well as the growth that we continue to have in terms of supply that we need for our customers. Putting those together, that’s where we came through with the guidance that we provided. I’m going to turn the rest over to Jensen to see how he wants to ...

ANSWER:
Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Ben. I would say compared to the beginning of the year, compared to the GTC timeframe, there are four positive surprises. The first positive surprise is the step-function demand increase of reasoning AI. I think it is fairly clear now that AI is going through exponential growth, and reasoning AI really busted through concerns about hallucination or its ability to really solve problems. I think a lot of people are crossing that barrier and realizing how incredibly effective agentic AI is and reasoning AI is. So number one is inference reasoning and the exponential demand growth there. The second one — you mentioned AI diffusion — it’s really terrific to see that the AI diffusion rule was rescinded. President Trump wants America to win, and he also realizes that we’re not the only country in the race. He wants the United States to win and recognizes that we have to get the American stack out to the world and have the world build on top of American stacks instead of alternatives. AI diffusion happened — the rescinding of it happened almost precisely at the time when countries around the world are awakening to the importance of AI as infrastructure, not just as a technology of great curiosity and importance, but as infrastructure for their industries, startups, and society. Just as they had to build out infrastructure for electricity and the internet, you’ve got to build out infrastructure for AI. I think that’s an awakening that creates a lot of opportunity. The third is enterprise AI. Agents work, and agents are really quite successful — much more than generative AI. Agentic AI is game-changing. Agents can understand ambiguous and rather implicit instructions, and are able to problem-solve, use tools, and have memory, and so on. I think enterprise AI is ready to take off. It’s taken us a few years to build a computing system able to run enterprise AI stacks and IT stacks together, adding AI to it. This is the RTX Pro Enterprise server that we announced at Computex just last week, and just about every major IT company has joined us and is super excited about that. Computing is one part of it, but remember enterprise IT has three pillars: compute, storage, and networking. We’ve now put all three of them together, and we’re going to market with that. Lastly, industrial AI. One of the implications of the world reordering, if you will, is regions onshoring manufacturing and building plants everywhere. In addition to AI factories, there are new electronics manufacturing and chip manufacturing facilities being built around the world. All these new plants and factories are coming at exactly the right time as Omniverse, AI, and robotics are emerging. This fourth pillar is quite important — every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. In order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data — more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. These four drivers are really kicking into turbocharge.

QUESTION:
Thanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask about China. It sounds like the July guidance assumes there’s no SKU replacement for the H20, but if the President wants the U.S. to win, it seems like you’re going to have to be allowed to ship something into China. So I guess I had two points on that. First of all, have you been approved to ship a new modified version into China and you’re currently building it, but just can’t ship it in fiscal Q2? And then, you were sort of running 7 to 8 billion a quarter into China — can we get back to those sorts of quarterly run rates once you get something that you’re allowed to ship back into China? I think we’re all trying to figure out how much to add back to our models and when. So whatever you can say there would be great. Thanks.

ANSWER:
The President has a plan. He has a vision, and I trust him. With respect to our export controls, it’s a set of limits, and the new set of limits pretty much makes it impossible for us to reduce Hopper any further for any productive use. The new limits are kind of the end of the road for Hopper. We have limited options, so the key is to understand the limits and see if we can come up with interesting products that could continue to serve the Chinese market. We don’t have anything at the moment, but we’re considering it — we’re thinking about it. Obviously, the limits are quite stringent at the moment, and we have nothing to announce today. When the time comes, we’ll engage the administration and discuss that.

QUESTION:
Hi, this is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on the great quarter. I was wondering if you could give some additional color around the strength you saw within the networking business, particularly around the adoption of your Ethernet solutions at CSPs, as well as any change you’re seeing in network attach rates.

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang
ROLE: Founder, President, CEO & Director
TIME: 0:56:45
ANSWER:
Yeah, thank you for that. We now have three networking platforms — maybe four. The first one is the scale-up platform to turn a computer into a much larger computer. Scaling up is incredibly hard to do; scaling out is easier to do, but scaling up is hard. That platform is called NVLink. NVLink comes with chips and switches and NVLink spines — it’s really complicated — but anyway, that’s our new scale-up platform. In addition to InfiniBand, we also have Spectrum-X. We’ve been fairly consistent that Ethernet was designed for a lot of traffic that is independent. But in the case of AI, you have a lot of computers working together, and the traffic of AI is insanely bursty. Latency matters a lot because the AI is thinking and it wants to get work done as quickly as possible, and you have a whole bunch of nodes working together. So we enhanced Ethernet, adding capabilities like extremely low latency, congestion control, and adaptive routing — the types of technologies that were available only in InfiniBand — to Ethernet. As a result, we improved the utilization of Ethernet in these clusters. These clusters are gigantic — from as low as 50% to as high as 85–90%. So the difference is, if you had a cluster that’s $10 billion and you improved its effectiveness by 40%, that’s worth $4 billion. It’s incredible. So Spectrum-X has been, quite frankly, a home run. This last quarter, as we said in the prepared remarks, we added two very significant CSPs to the Spectrum-X adoption. And the last one is BlueField, which is our control plane. The control plane of the network is used for storage, security, and for many of these clusters that want to achieve isolation among users — multi-tenant clusters that still need extremely high-performance, bare-metal performance. BlueField is ideal for that and is used in a lot of these cases. So we have these four networking platforms. They’re all growing, and we’re doing really well. I’m very proud of the team.

TEXT:
Thank you. This is the start of a powerful new wave of growth. Grace Blackwell is in full production — we’re off to the races. We now have multiple significant growth engines. Inference, once a delayed workload, is surging with revenue-generating AI services. AI is growing faster and will be larger than any platform shifts before, including the internet, mobile, and cloud.
Blackwell is built to power the full AI lifecycle — from training frontier models to running complex inference and reasoning agents at scale. Training demand continues to rise with breakthroughs in post-training techniques like reinforcement learning and synthetic data generation, but inference is exploding. Reasoning AI agents require orders of magnitude more compute. The foundations of our next growth platforms are in place and ready to scale. Sovereign AI nations are investing in AI infrastructure like they once did for electricity and the internet. Enterprise AI must be deployable on-prem and integrated with existing IT. Our RTX Pro, DGX Spark, and DGX Station Enterprise AI systems are ready to modernize the $500 billion IT infrastructure on-prem or in the cloud. Every major IT provider is partnering with us. Industrial AI — from training to digital-twin simulation to deployment — NVIDIA Omniverse and Isaac are powering next-generation factories and humanoid robotic systems worldwide. The age of AI is here. From AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI, and industrial AI — NVIDIA is ready. Join us at GTC Paris. I’ll keynote at VivaTech on June 11th, talking about quantum GPU computing, robotic factories, and robots, and celebrating our partnerships building AI factories across the region. The NVIDIA band will tour France, the UK, Germany, and Belgium.
