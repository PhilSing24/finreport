The scale and scope of these build outs present significant long term growth opportunities for NVIDIA. The GB200 NVL system is seeing widespread adoption with deployments at CSPs and consumer Internet companies, lighthouse model builders, including OpenAI, Meta, and Mistral are using the GB200 NVL72 at data centre scale for both training next generation models and serving inference models in production. The new Blackwell Ultra platform has also had a strong quarter, generating tens of billions in revenue. The transition to the GB300 has been seamless for major cloud service providers due to its shared architecture, software, and physical footprint with the GB200, enabling them to build and deploy GB300 racks with ease. The transition to the new GB300 rack-based architecture has been seamless

TEXT:
factory builds in late July and early August were successfully converted to support the GB300 ramp. And today, full production is underway. The current run rate is back at full speed, producing approximately 1,000 racks per week. This output is expected to accelerate even further throughout the third quarter as additional capacity comes online. We expect widespread market availability in the second half of the year as CoreWeave prepares to bring their GB300 instance to market as they are already seeing 10x more inference performance on reasoning models compared to H100.

This keeps us on track with our pace of an annual product cadence and continuous innovation across compute, networking, systems, and software. In late July, the US government began reviewing licenses for sales of H20 to China customers. While a select number of our China based customers have received licenses over the past few weeks, we have not shipped any H20 based on those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% of the revenue generated from licensed H20 sales. But to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement.

TEXT:
We have not included H20 in our Q3 outlook as we continue to work through geopolitical issues. If geopolitical issues reside, we should ship 2 to 5 billion dollars in H20 revenue in Q3. And if we add more orders, we can bill more. We continue to advocate for the US government to approve Blackwell for China. Our products are designed and sold for beneficial commercial use, and every license sale we make will benefit the US economy, the US leadership.

TEXT:
In highly competitive markets, we want to win the support of every developer. America's AI technology stack can be the world's standard if we race and compete globally. Notably in the quarter was an increase in H100 and H200 shipments. We also sold approximately 650 million of H20 in Q2 to an unrestricted customer outside of China. The sequential increase in Hopper demand indicates the breadth of data centre workloads that run on accelerated computing and the power of CUDA libraries and full stack optimizations, which continuously enhance the performance and economic value of our platform.

SPEAKER: Colette Kress
ROLE: EVP & CFO
TIME: 0:08:12
TEXT:
As we continue to deliver both Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, we are focusing on meeting the soaring global demand. This growth is fuelled by capital expenditures from the cloud to enterprises, which are on track to invest 600 billion in data centre infrastructure and compute this calendar year alone, nearly doubling in two years. We expect annual AI infrastructure investments to continue growing driven by the several factors, reasoning Agentic AI requiring orders of magnitude more training and inference compute, global build outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of physical AI and robotics. Blackwell has set the benchmark as it is the new standard for AI inference performance. The market for AI inference is expanding rapidly with reasoning and Agentic AI gaining traction across industries.

TEXT:
Blackwell's rack-scale NVLink and CUDA full stack architecture addresses this by redefining the economics of inference. New NVFP4  4-bit precision and NVLink 72 on the GB300 platform delivers a 50x increase in energy efficiency per token compared to Hopper, enabling companies to monetize their compute at unprecedented scale. For instance, a 3 million investment in GB200 infrastructure can generate 30 billion in token revenue, a 10x return. NVIDIA software innovation, combined with the strength of our developer ecosystem, has already improved Blackwell's performance by more than 2x since its launch. Advances in CUDA, TensorRT LLM, and Dynamo are unlocking maximum efficiency.

COMPANY: Cantor Fitzgerald
TIME: 0:25:34 
QUESTION: 
Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess with wafer in to rack out lead times of twelve months, you confirmed on the call today that Rubin is on track for ramp in the second half. And obviously, many of these investments are multi-year projects contingent upon power, cooling, etcetera. I was hoping perhaps you could you take a high-level view and speak to, you know, your vision for growth in into 2026. And as part of that, if you could kinda comment between network and data centre would be very helpful.
RESPONDER: Jensen Huang
ROLE: Founder, President, CEO & Director
TIME: 0:26:06
ANSWER:
Yeah. Thanks, CJ. At the highest level of growth drivers would be the evolution, the introduction, if you will, of reasoning Agentic AI. You know, where chatbots used to be one shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer. Now the AI does research. It thinks and does a plan, and it might use tools. And so it's called long thinking, and the longer it thinks, oftentimes, it produces better answers. And the amount of computation necessary for one shot versus reasoning Agentic AI models could be a 100 times, a thousand times, and potentially even more as the amount of research and basically reading and comprehension that it goes off to do. And so the amount of computation that has that has resulted in Agentic AI has grown tremendously. And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously. Because of Agentic AI, the amount of hallucination has dropped significantly. You can now use it you can now use tools and perform tasks. Enterprises have been opened up. As a result of Agentic AI and vision language models, we now are seeing a breakthrough in physical AI, in robotics, autonomous systems. So, last year, AI has made tremendous progress, and agentic systems, reasoning systems, is completely revolutionary. Now we built the Blackwell NVLink 72 system, a rack scale computing system, for this moment. We've been working on it for several years. This last year, we transitioned from NVLink eight, which is a node scale computing, each node is a computer, to now NVLink 72 where each rack is a computer. That disaggregation of NVLink 72 into a rack scale system was extremely hard to do, but the results are extraordinary. We're seeing orders of magnitude speed up and, therefore, energy efficiency and, therefore, cost effectiveness of token generation because of NVLink 72. And so you asked about longer term. Over the next five years, we're gonna scale into with Blackwell, with Rubin, and follow-ons to scale into effectively a 3 to 4 trillion dollars AI infrastructure opportunity. The last couple of years, you have seen that CapEx has grown in just the top four CSPs has doubled and grown to about 600 billion dollars. So, we're in the beginning of this build out, and the AI technology advances has really enabled AI to be able to adopt and solve problems to many different industries.

TIME: 0:29:33
QUESTION:
Thanks for taking my questions. Colette, just wanted to clarify the 2 to 5 billion dollars in China. What needs to happen? And what is the sustainable pace of that China business as you get into Q4? And then Jensen, for you on the competitive landscape, several of your large customers already have or are planning many ASIC projects. I think one of your ASIC competitors Broadcom signalled that they could grow their AI business almost 55% - 60% next year. Any scenario in which you see the market moving more towards ASICs and away from NVIDIA GPU? Just what are you hearing from your customers? How are they managing this split between their use of merchant silicon and ASICs? Thank you.

RESPONDER: Colette Kress
ROLE: EVP & CFO
TIME: 0:30:17
ANSWER:
Thanks, Vivek. So let me first answer your question regarding what will it take for the H20s to be shipped. There is interest in our H20s. There is the initial set of licenses that we received. And then, additionally, we do have supply that we are ready, and that's why we communicated that somewhere in the range of about 2 to 5 billion this quarter, we could potentially ship. We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do. So it's still, open at this time, and we're not exactly sure what that full amount will be about this quarter. However, if more interest arrives, more licenses arrive, again, we can also still build additional H20 and ship more as well.

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang
ROLE: Founder, President, CEO & Director
TIME: 0:31:17
ANSWER:
NVIDIA builds very different things than ASICs, let's talk about ASICs first. A lot of projects are started. Many startup companies are created. Very few products go into production, and the reason for that is it's really hard. Accelerated computing is unlike general purpose computing. You don't write software and just compile it into a processor. Accelerated computing is a full stack co design problem. And AI factories, in the last several years, has become so much more complex because of the scale of the problems have grown so significantly. It is really the ultimate the most extreme computer science problem the world's ever seen, obviously. And so the stack is complicated. The models are changing incredibly fast from generative based on autoregressive to generative based on diffusion to mixed models to multimodality, the number of different models that are coming out that are either derivatives of transformers or evolutions of transformers is just daunting. One of the advantages that we have is that NVIDIA's available in every cloud. We're available from every computer company. We're available from the cloud to on prem to edge to robotics on the same programming model. And so it's sensible that every framework in the world supports NVIDIA. When you're building a new model architecture, releasing it on NVIDIA is most sensible. And so the diversity of our platform, both in the ability to evolve into any architecture, the fact that we're everywhere, and, also, we accelerate the entire pipeline. You know, everything from data processing to pretraining to post training with reinforcement learning, all the way out to inference. And so when you build a data centre with NVIDIA platform in it, the utility of it is best. The lifetime usefulness is much, much longer. And then I would just say that, in addition to all of that, it is just a really extremely complex systems problem anymore. You know, people talk about the chip itself. There's one ASIC, the GPU that many people talk about. But in order to build Blackwell, the platform, and Rubin, the platform, we had to build CPUs that connect fast memory, low extremely energy efficient memory for large KB caching necessary for Agentic AI to the GPU to a super NIC to a scale up switch we call NVLink, completely revolutionary when we're in our fifth generation now, to a scale out switch, whether it's quantum or Spectrum-X Ethernet, to now scale across switches so that we could prepare for these AI super factories with multiple gigawatts of computing all connected together. We call that Spectrum-XGS. We just announced that at Hot Chips this week. And so the complications, the complexity of everything that we do is really quite extraordinary. It's just done  in a really, really extreme scale now. And then lastly, if I could just say one more thing. You know, we're in every cloud for a good reason. Not only do are we the most energy efficient, our perf per watt is the best of any computing platform. And in a world of power limited data centres, perf per watt drives directly to revenues. And, you know, you've heard me say before that in a lot of ways, the more you buy, the more you grow. And because our perf per dollar, the performance per dollar is so incredible, you also have extremely great margins. So the growth opportunity with NVIDIA's architecture and the gross margins opportunity with NVIDIA's architecture is absolutely the best. And so there's a lot of reasons why NVIDIA's chosen by every cloud and every startup and every computer company. We're, you know, really a holistic full stack solution for AI factories.

QUESTION:
Jensen, I wanted to ask you about your 3 to 4 trillion in data centre infrastructure spend by the end of the decade. Previously, you talked about something in the 1 billion range, which I believe was just for compute by 2028. If you take past comments, 3 to 4 trillion dollars would imply maybe 2 billion plus in compute spend. And just wanted to know if that was right and that's what you're seeing by the end of the decade. And wondering what you think your share will be of that. Your share right now of total infrastructure compute wise is very high. So wanted to see. And also if there's any bottlenecks you're concerned about like power to get to the 3 to 4 trillion. Thanks a lot

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang
ROLE: Founder, President, CEO & Director
TIME: 0:36:52
ANSWER:
Yeah. Thanks. As you know, the CapEx of just the top four hyperscalers has doubled in two years. As the AI revolution went into full steam, as the AI race is now on, the CapEx spend has doubled to 600 billion per year. There's five years between now and the end of the decade, and six hundred billion dollars, only represents the top four hyperscalers.
We still have the rest of the enterprise companies building on prem. You have cloud service providers building around the world. United States represents about 60% of the world's compute. And over time, you would think that artificial intelligence would reflect GDP scale and growth, and so and would be, of course, accelerating GDP growth. And so our contribution to that is a large part of the AI infrastructure. Out of a gigawatt AI factory, which can go anywhere from 50 to, you know, plus or minus 10%, let's say, to 60 billion we represent about 35 plus or minus of that. And 35 out of fifty or so, billion dollars for a gigawatt data centre. And there and, of course, what you get for that is not a GPU. I think people, you know, were famous for building the GPU and inventing the GPU. But as you know, over the last decade, we've really transitioned to become an AI infrastructure company. It takes six chips just to build six different types of chips just to build an AI and a Rubin AI supercomputer. And just to scale that out, you know, to a gigawatt, you have hundreds of thousands of GPU compute nodes and whole bunch of racks. And so, we're really an AI infrastructure company, and we're hoping to continue to contribute to growing this industry, making AI more useful, and then very importantly, driving the performance per watt because the world, as you mentioned, limiters, it will always likely be power limitations or AI building limitations. And so we need, to squeeze as much out of that factory as possible. NVIDIA's performance per unit of energy used drives the revenue growth of that factory. It directly translates. If you have a 100-megawatt factory, perf per 100 megawatt drives your revenues. It's tokens per 100 megawatts of factory. In our case, also, the performance per dollar spent is so high that your gross margins are also the best. But anyhow, these are these are the limiters going forward, and 3 to 4 trillion is fairly sensible for the next five years.

ANSWER:
The China market, I've estimated to be about 50 billion dollars of opportunity for us this year. If we were able to address it with competitive products and if it's 50 billion dollars this year, you would expect it to grow, say, 50% per year as the rest of the world's AI market is growing as well. It is the second largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China. The vast majority of the leading open-source models are created in China, and so it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market. And open source, as you know, is created in one country, but it's used all over the world. The open-source models that have come out of China are really excellent. DeepSeek, of course, gained global notoriety. Q1 is excellent. Kimi is excellent. There's a there's a whole bunch of new models that are coming out. They're multimodal. They're link great language models, and it and it's really fuelled the adoption of AI in enterprises around the world because enterprises wanna build their own custom proprietary software stacks. And so open open-source model is really important for enterprise. It's really important for SaaS who also would like to build proprietary systems. It has been really incredible for robotics around the world. And so open source is really important, and it's important that the American companies are able to address it. This is gonna be a very large market. We're talking to the administration about the importance of American companies to be able to address the Chinese market. And, as you know, H20 has been approved, for companies that are not on the entities list, and many licenses have been approved. And, so I think the, you know, the opportunity for us to bring Blackwell to the China market is a real possibility. And so we just have to keep advocating the sensibility of and the importance of American tech companies to be able to lead and win the AI race and help make the American tech stack the global standard.

QUESTION:
Yeah. Thank you for the question. I want to go back to the Spectrum-XGS announcement this week. And thinking about the Ethernet product now pushing over 10 billion of annualized revenue, just what is the opportunity set that you see for Spectrum-XGS? S,o do we think about this as kind of the data centre interconnect layer? Any thoughts on the sizing of this opportunity, you know, within that Ethernet portfolio? Thank you.

We now offer three networking technologies. One is for scale up, one is for scale out, and one for scale across. Scale up is so that we could build the largest possible virtual GPU, the virtual compute node. NVLink is revolutionary. NVLink 72 is what made it possible for Blackwell to deliver such an extraordinary generational jump over Hopper's NVLink *. At a time when we have long thinking models, agentic AI reasoning systems, the NVLink basically amplifies the memory bandwidth, which is really critical for reasoning systems. And so NVLink 72 is fantastic. We then scale out with networking, which we have two. We have InfiniBand, which is unquestionably the lowest latency, the lowest jitter, the best scale out network. It does require more expertise in managing those networks. And, for supercomputing, for the leading model makers, quantum InfiniBand is the unambiguous choice. If you were to benchmark an AI factory, the ones with InfiniBand are the best performance. For those who would like to use Ethernet because their whole data centre is built with Ethernet, we have a new type of Ethernet called Spectrum Ethernet. Spectrum Ethernet is not off the shelf. It has a whole bunch of new technologies designed for low latency and low jitter and congestion control, and it has the ability to come closer, much much closer, to InfiniBand than anything that's out there. And that's we call that Spectrum-X Ethernet. And then finally, we have Spectrum-XGS, a giga scale for connecting multiple data centres, multiple AI factories into a super factory, a gigantic system. And you're going to see that networking obviously is very important in AI factories. In fact, choosing the right networking, the performance, the throughput improvement going from, you know, 65% to 85% or 90%, that kind of step up because of your networking capability effectively makes networking free. You know choosing the right networking, you'll get a return on it like you can't believe because the AI factory, a gigawatt, as I mentioned before, could be 50 billion dollars. And so, the ability to improve the efficiency of that factory by tens of percent is resulting in 10-20 billion dollars’ worth of effective benefit. And so, you know, networking is a very important part of it. It's the reason why NVIDIA dedicates so much in networking. It's the reason why we purchased Mellanox five and a half years ago. And Spectrum-X, as we mentioned earlier, is now quite a sizable business, and it's only about a year and a half old. So, Spectrum-X is a home run. All of them are going to be fantastic. NVLink, scale up Spectrum-X and InfiniBand, scale out, and then Spectrum-XGS for scale across.

QUESTION:
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a more tactical question for Colette. So, on the guide, you're up over 7 billion. The vast bulk of that is going to be from data centre. How do I think about apportioning that 7 billion out across Blackwell versus Hopper versus networking? I mean it looks like Blackwell was probably 27 billion in the quarter, up from maybe 23 billion last quarter. Hopper is still 6 or 7 billion post the H20. Like do you think the Hopper strength continues? Just how do I think about parsing that 7 billion dollars out across all the three those three different components?

RESPONDER: Colette Kress

TIME:0:49:01
ANSWER:
Thanks, Stacy, for the question. First part of it, looking at our growth between Q2 and Q3, Blackwell is still going to be, the lion's share, of what we have in terms of data centre. But keep in mind, that helps both our compute side as well as it helps our networking side because we are selling those significant systems, that are incorporating the NVLink that Jensen, just spoke about. Selling Hopper, we are still selling H100 and H200. But, again, they are HGX systems, and I still believe our Blackwell will be the lion's share of what we're doing on there. So, we'll continue. We don't have any more specific details in terms of how we'll finish our quarter, but you should expect Blackwell again to be the driver of the growth.

QUESTION:
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've been very clear about the reasoning model opportunity that you see, and you've also been relatively clear about the technical specs for Rubin. But maybe you could provide a little bit of context about how you view the Rubin product transition going forward? What incremental capability does that offer to customers? And would you say that Rubin is a bigger, smaller or similar step up in terms of performance for capability perspective relative to what we saw at Blackwell? Thank you.

RESPONDER: Jensen Huang
ROLE: Founder, President, CEO & Director

ANSWER:
Yeah. Thanks. We're on an annual cycle with Rubin. And the reason why we're on an annual cycle is because we can do so to accelerate the cost reduction and maximize the revenue generation for our customers. When we increase the perf per watt, the token generation per amount of usage of energy, we are effectively driving the revenues of our customers. The perf per watt of Blackwell will be, for reasoning systems, an order of magnitude higher than Hopper. And so for the same amount of energy, and everybody's data centre is energy limited by definition, for any data centre that we using Blackwell, you'll be able to maximize your revenues compared to anything we've done in the past, compared to anything in the world today. And because the perf per dollar, the performance is so good that the perf per dollar invested in the capital, would also allow you to improve your gross margins. To the extent that we have great ideas for every single generation, we could improve the revenue generation, improve the AI capability, improve the margins of our customers by releasing new architectures. And so we advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves and to build these data centres on an annual rhythm. And Rub in is going to have a whole bunch of new ideas. I paused for a second because, you know, I've got plenty of time between now and a year from now to tell you about all the breakthroughs that Rubin's are going to bring. And but Rubins has a lot of great ideas. I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now. And I'll save it for GTC, to tell you more about it. But, nonetheless, for the next year, we're ramping really hard into now Grace Blackwell, GB200, and then now Blackwell Ultra, GB300. We're ramping really hard into data centres. This this this year is obviously a record-breaking year. I expect next year to be a record-breaking year. And while we continue to increase, the performance of, of AI capabilities as we race towards artificial superintelligence on the one hand and continue to increase the revenue generation capabilities of our hyperscalers on the other hand.

QUESTION:
Thanks a lot. Jensen, I wanted to ask you just answer the question you threw at a number, you said 50% CAGR for the AI market. So I'm wondering how much visibility that you have into next year. Is that kind of a reasonable bogey in terms of how much your data centre revenue should grow next year? I would think you'll grow at least in line with that CAGR. And maybe are there any puts and takes to that? Thanks.

ANSWER:
Well, I think the best way to look at it, we have reasonable forecasts from our large customers for next year. A very, very significant forecast. And we still have a lot of businesses that we're still winning and a lot of startups that are still being created. Don't forget that the number of startups for AI native startups was a 100 billion was funded last year. This year, the year is not even over yet. It's a 180 billion funded. If you look at AI native, the top AI native startups that are generating revenues, last year was 2 billion dollars. This year is 20 billion dollars. Next year, being 10 times higher than this year is not inconceivable. And the open-source models are now opening up large enterprises, SaaS companies, industrial companies, robotics companies to now join the AI revolution, another source of growth. And, you know, whether it's AI natives or enterprise SaaS or industrial AI or startups, we're just seeing just enormous amount of, interest in AI and demand for AI. Right now, the buzz is, I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything's sold out. H100 sold out. H200 are sold out. Large CSPs are coming out renting capacity from other CSPs. And so AI native startups were really scrambling to get capacity so that they could train their reasoning models. And so the demand is really, really high. But the long-term outlook between where we are today, CapEx has doubled in two years. It is now running about 600 billion dollars a year just in the large hyperscalers. You know, for us to grow into that 600 billion dollars a year, representing a significant part of that CapEx isn't unreasonable. And so I think the next several years, surely through the through the through the decade, we see just a really fast growing, really significant growth opportunities ahead. Let me conclude with this. Blackwell is the next generation AI platform the world's been waiting for. It delivers an exceptional generational leap. NVIDIA's NVLink 72 rack scale computing is revolutionary, arriving just in time as reasoning AI models drive order of magnitude increases in training and inference performance requirement. Blackwell Ultra is ramping at full speed, and the demand is extraordinary. Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represents the Rubin platform. They have all taped out to TSMC. Rubin will be our third generation NVLink rack-scale AI supercomputer, and so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain. Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the 3 to 4 trillion dollars global AI factory build out through the end of the decade. Customers are building ever greater scale AI factories from thousands of hopper GPUs in tens of megawatt data centres to now hundreds of thousands of Blackwells in 100 megawatt facilities. And soon, we'll be building millions of Rubin GPU platforms powering multi-gigawatt, multi-site AI super factories. With each generation, demand only grows.
One shot chatbots have evolved into reasoning, Agentic AI that research, plan, and use tools, driving orders of magnitude jump in compute for both training and inference. Agentic AI is reaching maturity and has opened the enterprise market to build domain and company specific AI agents for enterprise workflows, products, services. The age of physical AI has arrived, unlocking entirely new industries in robotics, industrial automation. Every industrial company will need to build two factories, one to build the machines and another to build their robotic AI. This quarter, NVIDIA reached record revenues and an extraordinary milestone in our journey. The opportunity ahead is immense. A new industrial revolution has started. The AI race is on. Thanks for joining us today, and I look forward to addressing our next earnings call. Thank you.
